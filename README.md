# Housing Price Prediction

> This project focuses on predicting housing prices based on various house features using machine learning models. The analysis aims to identify significant predictors of housing prices and provide insights that could assist real estate investors and sellers in understanding market dynamics.

## General Information
- This project develops predictive models to estimate the prices of houses based on their characteristics.
- The primary business problem addressed is the accurate prediction of house prices to aid in real estate decisions, thereby optimizing buying and selling strategies.
- The dataset used includes features such as the area of the house, number of rooms, age of the house, etc., and was sourced from a comprehensive real estate database.

## Conclusions
- High-quality materials and finishings (OverallQual) have a significant impact on housing prices.
- Features such as the size of the garage and basement area also play crucial roles in determining the price.
- The model using Lasso regression helped in pinpointing the most influential features by reducing the complexity of the model and eliminating less important features.
- The analysis revealed that both Ridge and Lasso regression models perform similarly well, but Lasso offers the additional benefit of feature selection.

## Technologies Used
- pandas - version 1.3.4
- numpy - version 1.21.2
- scikit-learn - version 0.24.2
- matplotlib - version 3.4.3

## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by the need to simplify real estate pricing strategies through data-driven insights.
- Gratitude goes to the contributors of the scikit-learn library for providing robust tools for machine learning.
- This project was based on insights gained from various real estate market analyses.
